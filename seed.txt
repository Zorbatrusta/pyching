seed(self, a=None) method of Random instance
        Initialize internal state of the random number generator.
        
        None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
        system specific randomness source if available.
        
        If a is not None or is an int or long, hash(a) is used instead.
        Hash values for some types are nondeterministic when the
        PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable is enabled.
